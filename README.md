# GTA Remix Fixes
An .asi modification for GTA games to make them compatible with RTX Remix(currently from Portal RTX)

Download: LINK COMING SOON

## How to use:
1. Install ASI Loader
2. Install RTX Remix
3. Drag-n-drop asi file to game folder(be sure to read ASI Loader Readme file beforehand, sometimes it doesn't load from game folder)
4. Run the game, you will still need to mark all the UI textures as such for now, but later this mod will feature configuration files
5. If you encounter reproducible bug you are welcome to report it, do be careful some bugs can't be fixed without support from NVIDIA team behind RTX Remix
